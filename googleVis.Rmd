# googleVis

Wenqi Sun

The googleVis package provides an interface between R and the Google's charts tools. It allows users to create web pages with interactive charts based on R data frames. Charts are displayed locally via the R HTTP help server. A modern browser with Internet connection is required. The data remains local and is not uploaded to Google.

I managed to create a cheatsheet for googleVis. It covers most charts and some options.
